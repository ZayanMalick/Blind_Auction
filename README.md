# Blind Auction:

## Description:

The Blind Auction is a simple Python program that simulates a silent auction. Participants can place their bids, and the program will announce the highest bidder and their bid amount once the bidding phase is over.

## Files:

main.py: The main script for the auction. It handles user input, manages bids, and determines the highest bidder.

art.py: Contains ASCII art that is displayed when the program starts. This file defines the logo variable used in main.py.

## How It Works:

Start the Program: Run main.py to start the auction. It will display the auction logo.

Place Bids: Enter your name and bid amount when prompted.

Continue Bidding: After placing your bid, you will be asked if there are other bidders. Type 'yes' to continue or 'no' to end the bidding.

Announce Winner: When bidding ends, the program will display the highest bid and the winner's name.
